# Cloud migration checkpoint

## Baseline

- TS snapshot: `47d0f7f9a3c75a6ec94b38833cd1992740efaeb3`.
- User-approved remote Rust authority: `release/stabilization-held-20261002`,
  commit `4e213aa69dc89bed1552d8b83e12471d7664b7ae`.
- This replaces the unavailable local frozen source for new work. It is not a
  claim that every previous unit has been revalidated against this commit.
- Linux Node 24.21.0: baseline 2,061 tests passed, zero failed/skipped; strict TS passed.
- From this checkpoint, implementation and review are performed directly by SSS
  at the user's request. AGY is not the author of the changes below.

## Borrowed async admission coordinator

`src/store/async-resolution-admission.ts` implements the unsettled query,
lifecycle admission loop, and policy/unsettled/lifecycle/legacy coordinator.
Authority: `crates/cdr-store/src/async_resolution.rs` (`held_in`) and
`async_resolution/lifecycle.rs` (`admission_held_in`) at the commit above.

The lifecycle query projects CASE-result storage class and bytes rather than
TEXT to prevent Node's eager row conversion from decoding an unused outcome or
the 129th row. It retains the SQL byte limit, filters, order, and LIMIT. Text is
decoded only when needed using the existing SQLite encoding decoder; encoding
is read lazily once per invocation. Ordinary records skip outcome conversion.
Native SQLite prepare/step errors propagate. Typed text conversion failures use
the existing TS StoreIntegrityError taxonomy; Rust exception class/message
identity is not claimed.

Validation: 14 new in-memory SQLite tests; full Linux suite 2,075 passed, zero
failed/skipped; strict TypeScript passed. Tests include invalid UTF-8, SQL types,
CASE NULL, UTF-8/UTF-16LE/UTF-16BE byte boundaries, 128/129 rows, control precedence,
refusal disposition, thread/owner filters, error masking, query-only reads and
caller transaction rollback. Diagnostic fixtures intentionally allow corrupt
types/NULL; they do not claim full production-schema reachability.
The raw UTF-16 test reuses all 22 retained Rust observations from
`migration/oracles/sqlite-utf16-0.40.2/decoded-results.json` through the new
lifecycle query. These are reused historical observations, not a fresh Rust run.

Remaining: fresh cross-language differential execution, complete raw malformed
UTF-16 matrix, complete runtime wiring, actual Discord/Codex
transport, Windows restart/end-to-end validation. A Rust toolchain installation
attempt's execution approval was cancelled; no fresh Rust oracle run is claimed.
No deployment, live database, credential, hook, or existing source changes.

Local logs: `.runtime/cloud-baseline-20261007/` and
`.runtime/cloud-admission-001/` (ignored execution evidence, not source artifacts).

## Owned reads and saved-request presentation

The owned admission and target-dispatch wrappers now use `openInitialized`,
close the first handle before opening the second, and skip the second open on
an admission hold. They are exposed through `StateAccessFacade` so the new
runtime presentation code performs state reads through that interface.

`presentSavedSubmission` and `withTargetHold` follow the Rust submission
presentation rules: only Pending/Starting jobs query admission; existing turn
IDs and protected warnings skip the read; current holds overlay a warning
without changing the stored job, attempts, queued flag or turn ID. Database
errors propagate rather than being converted into permission.

Full Linux suite: 2,084 passed, zero failed/skipped; strict TypeScript passed.
Three owned-store tests use real initialized temporary databases and verify
one/two-handle closure plus start/steer/thread behavior. Six presentation tests
use the state interface to check masking, warning precedence, isolation and
error identity. These are not live Discord execution or a complete queue
coordinator. Existing runtime intake/start/recovery orchestration remains open.
Latest local logs: `.runtime/cloud-admission-owned-002/`.

## Target serialization and queue read coordinator

`TargetLocks` implements shared normal/non-waiting target leases, FIFO waiting,
queued cancellation, idempotent release and cleanup after the final owner.
Unlike Rust RAII, JavaScript callers must release explicit leases or use `run`,
which releases in `finally`. Aborting a granted lease does not release its owner.
This is event-loop-local coordination, not a distributed/process-wide mutex.
Authority: `queue_runner.rs::target_lock`, `target_lease.rs` and lock-cache tests.

`QueueReadCoordinator.busyStatus` uses that shared lock and the exact backend →
queue-list → durable-hold-filter sequence; even an active turn does not mask a
later storage error. `controlBinding` preserves its unlocked read and exactly-one
Starting/Running non-goal-waiting selection. Storage reads go through the facade.
`eligibleJobs` excludes only held Pending records and does not mutate inputs.

Full Linux suite: 2,101 passed, zero failed/skipped; strict TypeScript passed.
New tests cover FIFO, cross-target progress, 1,000 historical target cleanups,
cancelled waiters, stale releases, errors, real queue/hold filtering and unchanged
attempt counts. A first test run caught unsupported TS parameter-property syntax;
explicit field declarations fixed it without changing Node execution flags.
Test job construction was shared rather than duplicated across runtime suites.
Latest logs: `.runtime/cloud-target-locks-003/`.

Still missing: claim-fenced start/ACK/failure transitions, resident late-stop
binding, full submit/completion/recovery coordination and transport/restart wiring.
The existing compatibility mutation helpers must not substitute for guarded
`try_begin_attempt` / `*_if_claimed` APIs.

## Claim-fenced queue mutations

`queue-claims.ts` now implements `tryBeginAttempt`,
`recordStartFailureIfClaimed`, and the **non-resident** `markRunningIfClaimed`.
Authority: `crates/cdr-store/src/queue/write/attempt.rs` at the pinned Rust commit.
All use one IMMEDIATE transaction owner and the exact job/target/generation/
attempt/timestamp/raw-baseline/state/turn/fork comparisons. Input snapshots are
captured before asynchronous initialization. Existing dead-generation, async
admission, baseline, reply-binding and origin helpers are reused.

Definite execution-held failure atomically writes the hold and notice; neither
may commit if the notice fails. ACK turn replacement by a trigger is rejected
and rolled back. A stale comparison returns no claim, never replay permission.
The non-resident ACK API does not accept a resident argument and must not replace
`mark_running_with_resident_if_claimed`; late-stop binding is still pending.

Full Linux suite: 2,119 passed, zero failed/skipped; strict TypeScript passed.
18 claim tests include competing callers, stale identities, generation/dead
holds, ignored/aborted updates, rollback, Unicode bounds, mutable caller input,
atomic notices and ACK/origin failures. This is not a cross-process contention
or Windows run. Clock precision remains Date.now milliseconds, unlike Rust's
submillisecond SystemTime. Typed AsyncResolutionHeld errors are defined here;
complete central runtime error routing remains unfinished.
Latest logs: `.runtime/cloud-claims-004/`.

## Resident ACK and previously accepted Stop custody

`markRunningWithResidentIfClaimed` now binds an exact late ACK within the same
IMMEDIATE writer transaction. `stop-late-start.ts` follows the pinned Rust
late-start helper and its revision, binding/mapping, hold-snapshot and intake-read
dependencies. It verifies the global/per-target stop revision, original job and
owner, accepted scope, existing hold, new turn and resident. Existing controls
are not widened or replaced. Insertion is followed by checks of pristine control
state, exact record retention, hold/job identity and unchanged latest scope.
Any failure rolls back both ACK and control receipt. It performs no interrupt.

StopControl JSON retains struct field order and opaque serialized job strings.
Settlement eligibility is false for broad/missing scope evidence or queue/intake
ID collision; the intake presence check decodes the full row rather than hiding
corrupt data behind SELECT EXISTS.

Full Linux suite: 2,130 passed, zero failed/skipped; strict TypeScript passed.
11 new DB tests cover ownership/turn limits, revisions, mapped/selected routes,
malformed scope/intake, collision, ignored inserts and hostile post-insert triggers.
This does not implement Stop acceptance/dispatch/terminal recovery as a whole.
Fresh Rust differential execution and Windows validation remain open.
Latest logs: `.runtime/cloud-late-stop-005/`.
